In my last blog I said "I'm going to build things". And I did, one. I completely re-wrote the [Taskly](https://github.com/f1-surya/taskly) app. New UI with a *KanBan board* to manage the tasks, multiple boards per user and *Postgres* instead of *MongoDB*. I didn't learn much and it wasn't that fun either.

After that I decided to learn *Java* and *Spring boot*. So I followed the roadmaps at [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/java). It was annoying at first, reading through the docs and guides without writing any code. And once I read enough to have some idea on what's going on, I decided to write a basic *REST API* with Username/Password auth. It took some time to get used to Spring boot's way of doing things, but I got it working.

And then something else came up. My parents run a **Cable TV** business. And our provider used a default placeholder name instead of actual names. But my mother had written down all the names of customers and their Smartcard number. This is slow. It takes 3-4 hours per month to pay the bills. And I'm the one who helps my mother with this. Finally I got tired of this and decided to digitize this process. So I downloaded the customers list from out providers portal and tried to rename each row by searching the Smartcard number with Google sheets. But it was too slow for me. I tried to use the AppScript thing but couldn't get it to work. So I wrote a very simple CLI based [app](https://github.com/f1-surya/excel-renamer) using *Go* to do this. And it kinda cheered me up a little. Because this is the first thing that I wrote that I actually find useful. And its going good so far. That's what I'm going to be doing in the next couple of days.

I also shifted my focus. Instead of filling up my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/f1-surya) with useless projects, I'm going to write interesting and things that I can use. And use more *Java*, no more *NextJS* and *Node*. Have fun with it. Don't think of getting a job by showcasing them. Going to build things because I want to.

That's all for this one. Bye bye
