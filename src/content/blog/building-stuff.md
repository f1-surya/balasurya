If you've been reading my blogs, you'll know I'm looking for a job. In the past
couple of months I've applied to lots of postings but I didn't even get a single reply.
I was very frustrated because of this and did some research and came to a conclusion
that I need to show some proof of work. And the apps I worked in during my
previous employments are either dead are hidden behind membership.

But I can always show my own projects that I worked during my free times. And they're all bad.
Here they are:

1. **MyWordle**: A local only wordle like native android app. I don't wanna work on android
   apps. The whole dev experience is a nightmare. So _irrelevent_.
2. **git-go**: I tried to implement the basic features of git with go for my own amusement.
   But I'm trying to be a web dev, so _irrelevent_.
3. **balasurya**: This website. It's only the frontend and I wish to work on backends too.
   So _not enough_.
4. **taskly**: A very simple task management app written in NextJS. The UX is very
   horrible. I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole. Just _embarrassing_.

So I've decided to make a bunch of full stack apps. Starting with **taskly**.
This is my plan for taskly:

1. Use `Auth.js` instead of implementing my own auth.
2. Use `PostgreSQL` with `drizzle-orm`.
3. Add **Kanban board** to manage the tasks.
4. Make the over-all UI more pleasing.

After this I'm planning making something with `go` for baceknd and `Svelte` SPA
for the frontend. And many projects. I don't know what they will be but I
hope that they'll be fun, challenging and rewarding.

That's all I have to say for this one. Bye bye.
