## git-go:
In the last [blog](https://balasurya.vercel.app/blog/im-free) I said I'm building a git like CLI app using Golang.
My goals with that project were **do not use any external packages** and implement the most basic features:
1. Add
2. Commit
3. Status
4. Log
5. Revert

I've done those. There are some advanced features like branches, remote origins and diff(the most difficult one) etc,.
I would like to implement those but I am a web developer and I think I should develop more web apps. Because right now
the web apps in my public GitHub repo are this website and a task manager like app(which is horrible to use and not my best work).
So I've been thinking about building a serious app that I can use every day. Using Gin and Go templates(probably. Manybe svelte).
But that deserves it's own blog.


## F1's back:
The 2025 Formula 1 season is starting this week in Australia. I'm so excited cause it seems like a tight grid this year.
McLaren's are the fastest, Ferrari's right behind and RedBull seem off(sadly). But I think RedBull would bounce back and
hopefully Max will win the title. But let's see.

## Finally reached the last book in LOTR:
Last year I began to read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings books. I've been busy and I didn't get much time to read(Maybe I was just lazy to read).
But finally I've reached **The Return of the King**, the last book in this series. I'm in the second chapter right now.
The books have been more exciting than I thought they would be and I'm planning on finishing it within next month.

That's all I had to say for this one.

Bye bye.
